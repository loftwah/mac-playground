## Quick Start üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### One-line Setup Script with Brewfile

To make setup as seamless as possible, use this one-liner to install Homebrew and all tools listed in a `Brewfile`:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo >> /Users/username/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/username/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew bundle --file=~/Brewfile
```

**New Addition**: Here‚Äôs a sample `Brewfile` to include all tools from this guide. Save it as `~/Brewfile`:

```ruby
# ~/Brewfile
tap "homebrew/bundle"

# Core formulae
brew "bat"
brew "exa"
brew "fd"
brew "ripgrep"
brew "fzf"
brew "zoxide"
brew "delta"
brew "gh"
brew "lazygit"
brew "mise"
brew "uv"
brew "tfenv"
brew "opentofu"
brew "kubectl"

# Casks
cask "raycast"
cask "iterm2"
cask "orbstack"

# Optional tools (uncomment if needed)
# brew "fish"         # Alternative shell
# cask "docker"       # Docker Desktop
# cask "utm"          # Virtualization
# cask "wireshark"    # Network analysis
# cask "little-snitch" # Firewall
```

> **Tip**: Customize the `Brewfile` to your needs and run `brew bundle install` to install everything at once!

## Core Tools üõ†

### Package Management

#### Homebrew

Install essential command-line tools and GUI apps:

```bash
# Installed via Brewfile above, but here‚Äôs the manual list:
brew install bat exa fd ripgrep fzf zoxide delta gh lazygit
brew install --cask raycast iterm2 orbstack tableplus dbeaver-community
```

### Terminal Setup

#### iTerm2 + Oh My Zsh (or Alternatives)

1. **Install Oh My Zsh**:

   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   brew install zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-completions
   ```

2. **Configure `.zshrc`**:

   ```bash
   # ~/.zshrc
   ZSH_THEME="agnoster"  # Try "powerlevel10k" for a modern look
   plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-completions fzf aws docker)
   source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
   ```

3. **Optional Alternative**: Install Fish for a simpler, user-friendly shell:

   ```bash
   brew install fish
   # Add to /etc/shells and set as default: chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish
   ```

> **Tip**: Customize your theme with `p10k configure` if using Powerlevel10k!

---

## Development Environment üíª

### Language Version Manager

#### mise

```bash
brew install mise
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
mise use --global node@20 python@3.12 ruby@3.3 go@1.22 rust@stable java@21
mise install
mise ls
```

**New Addition**: Added Java for broader language support.

### Python Development

#### Modern Python with uv

```bash
brew install uv
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pandas numpy torch ruff pytest poetry pdm rich httpx pydantic hatch pyright
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Choose between `poetry`, `pdm`, or `hatch` based on your workflow‚Äîeach excels at dependency management.

### IDE & Editor Setup

Use **Cursor** or **VS Code**.  
**Optional**: Consider these extensions:

- VS Code: `Python`, `GitLens`, `Docker`
- Cursor: Built-in AI tools suffice for most tasks.

---

## Cloud & DevOps ‚òÅÔ∏è

### Modern Container Setup

#### OrbStack (with Docker Desktop Note)

```bash
brew install --cask orbstack
orb kubernetes enable
```

**Note**: OrbStack is lightweight and ideal for most workflows. Use Docker Desktop (`brew install --cask docker`) if you need advanced Compose features or specific integrations.

### Infrastructure as Code

#### Terraform & OpenTofu

```bash
brew install tfenv opentofu
tfenv install latest
tfenv use latest
tofu init
```

### Cloud CLI Tools

```bash
brew install awscli kubectl k9s kubectx lens helm aws-nuke aws-vault steampipe session-manager-plugin
aws configure sso
```

---

## Security & Privacy üîí

### 1Password CLI

```bash
brew install --cask 1password-cli
op plugin init ssh
```

### GPG & SSH

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C "your_email@example.com"
brew install gnupg
gpg --full-generate-key
git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

### File Encryption with age

```bash
brew install age
age-keygen -o key.txt
age -r <PUBLIC_KEY> secretfile.txt > secretfile.txt.age
```

**New Addition**: Backup with Time Machine or install `brew install --cask backblaze`.

---

## Productivity Boosters üöÄ

### Modern CLI Alternatives

```bash
brew install bat exa fd ripgrep duf bottom zoxide choose sd procs dust tealdeer just difftastic hyperfine
```

### Git Enhancements

```bash
brew install git-delta lazygit gh git-flow-avh git-absorb git-branchless
git config --global core.pager "delta"
```

---

## Advanced Configurations ‚öôÔ∏è

### Shell Aliases

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
alias ls='exa --icons --git'
alias ll='exa -l --icons --git'
alias cat='bat --style=full'
alias cd='z'
alias top='btm'
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Enhance Raycast with scripts:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.raycast/scripts
# Example: Create a script to open your dev folder
echo '#!/bin/bash\nopen ~/dev' > ~/.raycast/scripts/dev.sh
chmod +x ~/.raycast/scripts/dev.sh
```

### Finder Tweaks for Windows Users

To make Finder feel more like Windows Explorer, tweak these built-in settings‚Äîno extra software needed. These changes will give you a familiar layout and workflow if you‚Äôre coming from Windows:

1. **Show Full Paths** (like Windows breadcrumbs):
   - Open Finder, go to `View > Show Path Bar`. This adds a clickable folder hierarchy at the bottom, similar to Windows‚Äô address bar.
   - Optional: For the full path in the title bar, run this in Terminal:

     ```bash
     defaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool YES; killall Finder
     ```

2. **Show All File Extensions** (like turning off "Hide extensions for known types"):
   - Go to Finder > Preferences > Advanced.
   - Check "Show all filename extensions" so files like `document.txt` don‚Äôt hide the `.txt`.

3. **Quick Access to Drives** (like "This PC"):
   - Finder > Preferences > General > Set "New Finder windows show" to "Macintosh HD" (instead of "Recents").
   - Finder > Preferences > Sidebar > Check "Hard disks" and "External disks" to see all drives in the sidebar.

4. **Show Item Info** (like Windows status bar):
   - In Finder, go to `View > Show Status Bar`. This shows folder size and item count at the bottom, like Explorer‚Äôs details.

5. **Open Folders in New Windows** (like Windows default behavior):
   - Finder > Preferences > General > Uncheck "Open folders in tabs instead of new windows" to mimic Windows‚Äô separate window style.

> **Tip**: Drag frequently used folders (e.g., Documents, Downloads) to the sidebar for quick access, like pinned items in Windows. Use `Command + Up` to go up a folder (similar to Backspace in Explorer).

## Maintenance & Optimization üßπ

### System Maintenance

```bash
brew cleanup && brew autoremove && brew doctor
brew update && brew upgrade
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
brew install htop btop glances speedtest-cli neofetch vector grafana prometheus
```

### Disk Cleanup

```bash
brew install ncdu dust
ncdu ~
dust ~
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Permissions**: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/homebrew/*`
- **SSH Issues**: Verify `~/.ssh/config`.
- **OrbStack Conflicts**: Stop Docker Desktop if ports clash.
- **Kubernetes**: Check CNI plugin compatibility.

---

## Pro Tips üí°

1. **Bun for Node.js**:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   bun init
   bun install
   ```

2. **Faster Navigation**:

   ```bash
   zoxide init zsh >> ~/.zshrc
   z myproject  # Jumps to ~/myproject
   ```

3. **Virtualization** (Optional):

   ```bash
   brew install --cask utm  # Lightweight VMs
   ```
